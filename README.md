Below that, we have the list of the features we offer that makes us different than other portals followed by some numbers to show the great support and work of our team and the accomplishments. After that, we talk about how our web portal is a secured way to deliver applications , services and links in an interactive way on a single platform. The main feature of our web portal is the privacy, as it works as a private resource that can only be accessed unless you have unique credentials and gathers information from various resources. We run the applications on a local and secure server to eliminate/minimize the threat of data leakage or data compromising.
